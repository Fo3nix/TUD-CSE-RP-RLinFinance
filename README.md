## Installation
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the base folder of this project.

TA-Lib Note: If TA-Lib is part of the requirements, you might need to install the underlying TA-Lib C library first. Installation steps vary by operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux). Check the TA-Lib-wrapper documentation on PyPI or Conda-forge for instructions. stockstats (currently inside requirements.txt) is often used as an alternative within FinRL and doesn't have this external dependency.
